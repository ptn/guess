# guess

An AI bot that reads examples of "valid" and "invalid" series of 3 numbers and 
tries to guess the rule that makes them valid or invalid, i.e it produces the 
boolean rule that classifies sample 3-tuples correctly - it guesses the 
pattern. For example, if the bot reads the following lines as valid examples:

10 20 30
100 200 300
2 7 8
4 9 15

and the following as invalid examples:

80 13 0
4 5 0
5 1 10
10 50 30

It should output an expression equivalent to the following:

x < y AND y < z

That is, it guesses that the numbers are in ascending order.

## Usage

Clone the repo and invoke lein with one of the example input files:

lein run examples/all_equal.txt
lein run examples/ascending_order.txt
lein run examples/plus_one.txt

## Input file format

Just list examples of valid 3-tuples, one per line, insert a blank line, and 
list the examples of invalid 3-tuples.
